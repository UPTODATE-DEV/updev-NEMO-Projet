# NEMO

NEMO is a mobile data collection and analysis web application. Originally designed for the [Carter Center](https://www.cartercenter.org), it can be used in many different contexts for data collection.

Consider NEMO if you need:

- Integrated form design
- Standardized form sets
- Multiple data entry paths, including web, ODK Collect, and SMS
- Multiple mission/project management
- Advanced user management with multiple permission levels
- SMS broadcasting
- Custom, real-time reporting
- Offline operation in poorly-connected areas
